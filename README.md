# RJIS WRO Future Engineers AI Self-Driving Robot
 
Our team consists of two students from Riyadh Jazan Internaitional School (RJIS). We are from Jazan, the southernmost region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We are competing for the WRO Future Engineers competition. This is a worldwide competition in which teams compete to get their robot to complete two rounds, three laps for each round, using AI.

Our team, which is named RJIS Robotics, consists of two students:

• Ameer Abdullah Essa Masmali

• Khallad Mohammed Ahmed Madkhali

Our robot contains eight distinctive components with their own functions that contribute to the robot:

HuskyLens camera sensor – Uses color recognition with its camera to identify the colors (blue, red, green).

3 ultrasonic sensors – Used to trigger sonar waves to detect the walls. The waves will hit the wall and bounce back. When the waves bounce back, the the robot will understand where the walls/boundaries are.

Servo motor – Used for steering the two front wheels.

Large motor – Used for moving the two rear wheels.

Motor driver – Used to control the speed of the robot using code.

Arduino Uno – A controller board that uses the code that we downloaded into it to control the entire robot; all the wires of the robot are attached to the Arduino Uno. You can say the Arduino Uno is the brain of the robot.

Lego structure – The structure of the robot.

Yellow wheels – The wheels of the robot.

Nowadays there are many accidents on the roads. Most of the accidents on the road are due to human error. Our robot can completely fix this issue and make the streets safer and more efficient for all. Another major problem is climate change. One of the biggest causes of climate change is cars. Our robot will make the planet clean and safe for all.

The robot must complete two rounds with three laps for each round. The robot uses the HuskyLens camera sensor, which uses AI for color recognition so that the robot can detect three different colors. The robot detects the colors blue, red, and green. The blue line is found on the four corners on the track, and after the robot passes 4 blue lines, the robot becomes aware that it completes a lap. The red and green colors are from the blocks used in the second round. In the second round, the robot will have to maneuver around the red blocks by moving around the right side of the red blocks. When the robot identifies the green blocks, it will move around the left side of the green blocks.

We truly believe our robot can affect the world in spectacular ways. This robot can simplify jobs, reduce accidents on the roads, improve the environment, and bring vast opportunities for the future.
